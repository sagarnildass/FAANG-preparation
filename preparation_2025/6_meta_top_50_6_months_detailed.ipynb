    "- The goal is to return the **vertical order traversal** of a binary tree's nodes.\n",
    "- Vertical order traversal groups nodes based on their column index:\n",
    "  1. Nodes in the same column are grouped together.\n",
    "  2. Columns are processed from left to right.\n",
    "  3. For nodes in the same row and column, their order should follow their left-to-right traversal order.\n",
    "- Ask clarifying questions:\n",
    "  - What should be returned if the tree is empty? (Typically, an empty list.)\n",
    "  - Are all nodes guaranteed to have unique values? (Not required for this problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Brute Force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Traversal**:\n",
    "   - Use a depth-first traversal to calculate the column index and row index of each node.\n",
    "   - For each node:\n",
    "     - The left child decreases the column index by 1.\n",
    "     - The right child increases the column index by 1.\n",

    "2. **Group by Column**:\n",
    "   - Use a dictionary to store nodes grouped by their column index.\n",
